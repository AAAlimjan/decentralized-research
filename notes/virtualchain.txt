Virtualchain
------------

Virtualchain
- logical layer for multiplexing multiple fork consistent replicated state machine on top of blockchains (hashchains)
- app nodes replay their journal to achieve application level consensus at each block
- nodes agree on a block if and onlu if the application transactions in that block leave nodes in an identical state

Consensus hash
- enable nodes to independently audit and efficiently query their journals
- migrate journals across blockchain
- process
  - nodes scan blockchain to determine good transactions
- derived from accepted state transitions & geometric series of prior CH


Blockchain
- journal of state transition
- append-only
- replicated
- totally ordered
- tamper resistent

Building applications on top of blockchains
- use to bootstrap global state (secure, decentralized)
- challenge 1
  - blockchain can go offline, consensus can get centralized
  - application journals should be migrateable
  - crosschain migrations
- challenge 2
  - app jorunal can be forked, corrupted by underlining blockchains
  - on forks we have inconsistent branches
