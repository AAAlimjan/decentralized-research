Versum: Verifiable Computations over Large Public Logs
------------------------------------------------------

- Refereed delegation of computation, RDoC
  - Problem: Delegating computation, clients want to know if the computation has been done correctly. For example, relying on the majority of agreeing servers is not a guarantee that the computation has been done correctly.
  - Problem: It is not practical for the client to execute code themselves
  - Assumption: Not all the servers are compromised
  - In case of disagreement, the referee (the client) will resolve the conflict by performing a single step of computation

- Quin's Protocol
  - splits the computation in many parts and finds the first point of disagreement
  - determines which server made a mistake
  - continues with the honest node

- Probabilistically Checkable Proofs
  - Not practical

- SEQHASH

- Authenticated Data Structures
  - allow client to outsource storage of large dataset without trusting the server
  - client stores a small authenticator that summarized the data stored

--

Problem
Blockchains, Certificate Transparency & co have large and frequently changing authenticated data structures and doing computation on those could be expensive for lightweight clients.

Claim
- Securely outsourcing expensive computation over large and frequently changing data structures
- A lightweight client can outsource a computation over Bitcoin blockchain to a pool of independent servers and can determine correct result as long as it reaches one honest server

Assumptions
- Any-trust model: At least one server is honest when servers disagree or no every server can be compromised

Contributions
- low-server side overhead for re-computation and conflict resolution
  - computation as functional programs (memoization)
    - no global state
  - recording evaluation trace in a computation history (easy to evaluate where servers made mistakes)
  - new authenticated data structure for sequences
- (Compared to Quin) supports incremental updates of inputs
  - (Quin)handling updates one by one does not scale, since it means re-running the computation
  - (Versum) reuses the old computation

Design
- Lightclient sends a computation to a pool of independent
- 

Performance
- 365 GB (from 14GB)
- server can serve 4000 queries per second
